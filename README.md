# JetCloudSim
Continuing the work in jet-clouds.phys.uoa.gr (Papachristou M. Master Thesis under the supervistion of Vlahakis N. and Dasyra K.) we propose a series of low resolution and small timescale simulations of a relativistic black hole jet impacting gas clouds in a galaxy, in order to study how the propagation of a powerful, relativistic jet affects the dense gas that collapses to form new stars.. 

Towards a more realistic simulation we will make use of several approaches regarding the presence of external magnetic fields. 

The goal of this project is to establish a fine tuned simulation which we will try in a supercomputer in a higher resolution and larger timescales.
